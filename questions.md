  # We will not give you points if you visit every element in the array every 
  # time you search.

# uncrackable code by simply taking each letter of a message and incrementing it
# by a fixed number, so "abc" by 2 would look like "cde", wrapping around back
# to "a" when you pass "z".  Write a function, `caesar_cipher(str, shift)` which
# will take a message and an increment amount and outputs the encoded message.
# Assume lowercase and no punctuation. Preserve spaces.
#
# To get an array of letters "a" to "z", you may use `("a".."z").to_a`. To find
# the position of a letter in the array, you may use `Array#find_index`.

# result, called the "digital root". **Do NOT use the built in `Integer#to_s`
